[FCC proposes **ATSC 3.0** rule-change boost](/rp1/ATS3%20Rules.docx)
*The Federal Communications Commission has adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on proposed technical rule changes to facilitate the use of the US’s next generation television broadcast standard, ATSC 3.0. The proposed rules would permit greater flexibility for broadcasters to use distributed transmission systems (DTS) as they deploy ATSC 3.0 in their networks. DTS employs two or more transmission sites located around a station’s service area, each using the same RF channel and synchronised to manage self-interference. DTS can permit broadcast signals to serve hard-to-reach viewers, improve indoor and mobile reception, and more efficiently use*
